# U.S. Census Application

This will help people navigate US census data easily

OK here are some of the ideas that needs to be implemented

## Data Explorer (D tab)

- Make a homepage of Data Explorer tab that contains a simple table of indexes and their meaning
  - 01 is total population
  - 02 is race
  - 19 - Income
- When a person enters a category like they select 19, all the tables related to 19 will show
  up with their names and then user can click on the arrow to expand the column names and the user
  can either select the column or the table
  - keep in mind that other 19-20 categories are still up there displayed
- User can select download button to download clean data of that specific table
- Or the user right clicks the data to say open this in Profile Explorer (P tab) or choropleth map(C tab) tab
- Need to think more about the geography part

## Profile Explorer (P tab)

- Make a bar chart area to compare
- Use the smallest and the largest geography to compare a particular variable, proabably provide two options smallest and largest to compare and then user can delete it
- User can click on the bar and the bar will go in more detail - think more on what detail

## Choropleth tab (C tab)

-Opens with a US map
